    Steps of installation:
    1. Project Planning
    Before starting the coding process, it’s important to plan out your website structure. Here’s a basic outline of the project:
              *A homepage where users can see available polls.
              *A page to show poll results.
              *A page with a form for submitting responses.
    Styling:
        You’ll be using CSS for layout and design.
        Make sure the design is responsive (works on both desktop and mobile).
        
    2. Setting Up  Project Directory
    
    3. Creating the HTML Pages
            Let’s start by creating the basic HTML structure for each page.
        3.1 index.html (Homepage - Poll List)
            This page will list the available polls.
        3.2 poll.html (Poll Form Page)
            This page allows users to vote on a specific poll.

    4. Styling the Pages with CSS

    5. Testing the Website

    6. Future Enhancements :
            Dynamic Poll Results: If you want to make the results dynamic, you can integrate JavaScript and a backend 
                                (like PHP, Node.js, or Firebase) to store and retrieve poll responses.
            User Authentication: If you want users to register or log in before voting, you’ll need to add login
                                  functionality.
            Mobile Responsiveness: Make sure to use media queries to make your website responsive on different screen sizes.
